Test Summary
============

This file contains a list of all the tests within the test suite, and what particular things they are trying to test.  The main divisions are the following:

| 01.     processing/memory speed
| 01b-e.  disk speed
| 01f     index write speed
| 01g-h   index read speed
| 02-03.  SORT
| 04.     JOIN
| 05.     Grouped aggregation
| 06.     Hash dedup
| 07.     Keyed join
| 08.     Index read inside a child query
| 09.     Global index read
| 10.     Simple child queries
| 11.     Smart join testing
| 12.     Parallel execution
| 13.     Splitters
| 14.     Concat/Funnel
| 15.     SOAPCALL
| 80.     Various miscellaneous tests picked up from other places.

ToDo:
* PARSE
* LOOP
* PARALLEL PROJECT
* PREFETCH PROJECT
* GROUPED concat
* index aggregation
* Child queries - trivial, and more complex.

Each of the tests can belong to one or more classes.  These classes allow subsets of the tests to be selectively
included or excluded from the test.  The following general classes are supported:

* child - involves a child query
* disk - reads or writes datafiles from the disk
* index - performs index operations  
* memory - purely memory based, not access to disk
* parallel - contains tests that particularly test multi threading
* quick - a test that should only take a few seconds
* stress - designed to push the system to the limit.  Likely to take a long time to complete.
* summary - generates a summary report

And the following operation-specific classes are supported.  (The class is also indicated below.)

* create
* diskwrite
* diskread
* indexwrite
* indexread
* sort
* distribute
* join
* smartjoin
* hashaggregate
* hashdedup
* keyedjoin
* indexread
